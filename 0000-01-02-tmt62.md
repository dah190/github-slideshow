The Bop It device will be a small enclosure powered by either a 9V battery or 2 AA batteries. The device will have a rocker switch to turn the device on. The user can start a new game by pressing the new game button. A group of three LEDs will act as a countdown so the player can get ready. Once the last LED goes out, the first command will output. The command output will be auditory and through an LCD screen (for accessibility).
The commands will be:
•	Bop It (Press the big button)
•	Twist It (Flick a joystick)
•	Pull It (Pull on something like a pinball launcher)
•	Shake It (Shake the device, internal accelerometer reacts) 
The player will have ten seconds to do the first command and the interval decreases by 0.7 seconds for every correct action. The player gets one point for every correct action. Successful actions will be indicated by turning on a green LED until the next command is called, which will turn off the LED. Failures are indicated by a blinking red LED and an audible buzz. Whenever the player finishes a round, their score is displayed on an LCD screen. If the player reached the end (99 points) all the LEDs will blink, signifying the end of the game.
